										<h3>Smart Arrows</h3>
										<p>Smart Arrows is an ongoing personal project.  I have recently picked up the sport of target archery and was looking for a way to improve my practice regime.  In archery there are many factors that lead to a more accurate shot.  Using google forms and google sheets, I have developed a system to track shot progressions, yard performance, individual arrow performance,  Bow set up changes, and practice session statistics. I plan to turn this idea into a mobile based application. </p>
