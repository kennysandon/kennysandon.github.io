This instinctual design is what I strive for. Using software including, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe XD, Sketch, MS Visual Studio I craft a familiar feeling in my designs. </p>

In archery there are many factors that lead to a more accurate shot.  Using Google Forms and Google Sheets, I developed a system to track shot progressions, yard performance, individual arrow performance,  bow set up changes, and practice session statistics.
